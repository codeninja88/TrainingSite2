        <h1>Study</h1>
        <h2>Primary School</h2>
    <p>
        My Schooling began at Adelaide Primary. I attended this school until i'd completed second grade and then moved up to the FNQ with my family where the remainder of my schooling was spent. However, due to Queensland's rediculous education system i was forced to repeat the second grade upon arriving in Cairns which was a huge kick in the shins. I could already read and write quite well thanks to the South Australian education system and had to re-learn it all again for a year.
    </p>

        <h2>Secondary School</h2>
        Cairns State High School was the site of my secondary education. These were some of the best years of my life but at the same time my worst. I favoured Japanese and graduated with an OP6 putting me in the top 4% of Australian graduates.

        </p>

        <h2>University</h2>
        <p>This was where my life turned around and i finally found myself. At 25 i was long past my teenage years but at long last i was discovering the social aspect i missed growing up as a loner. The journey is still in play. </p>
        <h3>Current Subjects</h3>
        <li>CP2011 - Advanced Programming</li>
        <li>CP2010 - Web Programming</li>
        <li>CP2014 - Animation and Simulation</li>
        <li>EL1100 - Critical Reading</li>

        <h3>Study Goal</h3>
        <p>My goal at this point remains undecided. With a keen interest in software development and coding in general i decided to take this course so as to further develope my skillset and find myself a new career path. That path, however, is like a road whose end is hidden behind fog. I am hoping that with further development i will begin to see where my interests lie greater than others and take to that path a little stronger.</p>
