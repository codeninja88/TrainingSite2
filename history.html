    <h2>The Web</h2>
        <p>I guess my earliest memory of the web would have to be in primary school. I remember the sound of the dial-up as i waited... and waited... and waited... for what would seem incredibly slow internet access by today's standards.<br />
        I can remember 'Ask Jeeves' was all the rage at the time and my classmates and i would attempt to find all our homework answers through this wonderful (insert sarcasm here!) website.</p>
